# Air Quality Prediction and Analysis using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing real-time air quality data using predictive analytics and machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict pollution intensity, classify air quality levels, and identify pollution patterns across different locations.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess air quality data
- Perform exploratory data analysis
- Build and compare regression models
- Classify air quality into Low, Moderate, and High levels
- Identify pollution patterns using clustering
